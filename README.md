## Overview

I am an embedded systems and hardware engineer with hands-on experience in
designing, building, and testing microcontroller-based systems.
My work focuses on **practical, production-oriented hardware**, where reliability,
signal integrity, and power stability are critical.

This repository serves as a technical portfolio showcasing selected projects
that demonstrate my ability to work across hardware design that I have undertaken.
