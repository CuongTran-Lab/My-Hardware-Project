## Overview

I am an embedded systems and hardware engineer with hands-on experience in
designing, building, and testing microcontroller-based systems.
My work focuses on **practical, production-oriented hardware**, where reliability,
signal integrity, and power stability are critical.

This repository serves as a technical portfolio showcasing selected projects 
that demonstrate my ability to work across hardware design that I have undertaken.

###Hardware Design

- Hands-on experience with multiple MCU families: ESP32, PIC, AVR, WCH (CH32 series).
- Schematic design & PCB layout for 2-layer boards.
- Practical experience in hardware bring-up, testing, and debugging.
- Ability to identify and fix HW–FW interaction issues (signal, power, timing, communication).
  
#### Tools & Practice

- Schematic & PCB tools (KiCad / Altium-style workflow).
- Oscilloscope, multimeter, basic debugging instruments.
- Technical documentation and design explanation.
