This circuit is designed to acquire 4–20 mA signals from a gas sensor.
The measured gas concentration is displayed on an LCD, along with the system operating time.
The controller supports configurable upper and lower setpoints, allowing it to activate relays at two distinct gas concentration thresholds for alarm or control purposes.
