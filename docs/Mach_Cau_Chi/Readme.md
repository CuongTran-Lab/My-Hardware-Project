This board is an automotive fuse control module designed to distribute power to external in-vehicle devices.
When the ACC signal (representing the ignition key state) is present, the outputs are energized and the MCU monitors the system status.
When the ACC signal is turned off, OUT1 and OUT2 are disconnected, while the remaining outputs continue to be powered, enabling support for devices that require continuous power such as GPS trackers, charging circuits, or always-on peripherals.
